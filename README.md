# secrRFS
Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture Random Field Simulator

This package implements a simulation-based method for predicting overdispersion of n. 

**secrRFS** depends on **secr** 4.6.5 or later. **RandomFields** and **spatstat** 
are required for some options.

**secrRFS** is NOT available on CRAN.

The code here is under development. It may be installed using
```
devtools::install_github("MurrayEfford/secrRFS")
```

Please report problems as Issues on GitHub.
